# HaloFloodFanGame01

Sacrilege is a Halo fan game developed in Unreal Engine 5 with the base mechanics of Halo in mind but also extending upon it. 

Currently, the only gamemode featured is Firefight: A Wave-based survival mode but with a twist compared to normal Halo. Upon killing enemies, you can use a PDA to call down requisitions using requistion power to strengthen your fight. Fully multiplayer compatible, but bugs are to be expected.
